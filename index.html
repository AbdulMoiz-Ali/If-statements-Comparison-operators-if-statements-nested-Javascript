      <h1>-: If statements :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Suppose you code a prompt that asks, "Where does the Pope live?" <br />
        If the user answers correctly, you display an alert congratulating him.
        <br />
        This is the code. <br />
        1 var x = prompt("Where does the Pope live?"); <br />
        2 if (x === "Vatican") { <br />
        3 alert("Correct!"); <br />
        4 } <br />
        If the user enters "Vatican" in the prompt field, the congratulations
        alert displays. If he <br />
        enters something else, nothing happens. (This simplified code doesn't
        allow for other correct <br />
        answers, like "The Vatican." I don't want to get into that now.) <br />
        There's a lot to take in here. Let's break it down. <br />
        An if statement always begins with if. The space that separates it from
        the parenthesis is <br />
        new to you. I've taught you to code alerts and prompts with the opening
        parenthesis running up <br />
        against the keyword: alert("Hi"); Now I'm asking you not to do that in
        an if statement. It's <br />
        purely a matter of style, but common style rules sanction this
        inconsistency. <br />
        Following the if keyword-plus-space is the condition that's being
        tested—does the <br />
        variable that's been assigned the user's response have a value of
        "Vatican"? <br />
        The condition is enclosed in parentheses. <br />
        If the condition tests true, something happens. Any number of statements
        might execute. In <br />
        this case, only one statement executes: a congratulatory alert displays.
        <br />
        The first line of an if statement ends with an opening curly bracket. An
        entire if statement <br />
        ends with a closing curly bracket on its own line. Note that this is an
        exception to the rule that <br />
        a statement ends with a semicolon. It's common to omit the semicolon
        when it's a complex <br />
        statement that's paragraph-like and ends in a curly bracket. <br />
        But what about that triple equal sign? You might think that it should
        just be an equal sign, <br />
        but the equal sign is reserved for assigning a value to a variable. If
        you're testing a variable <br />
        for a value, you can't use the single equal sign. <br />
        If you forget this rule and use a single equal sign when you should use
        the triple equal <br />
        sign, the code won't run properly. <br />
        As you might expect, you can use a variable instead of a string in the
        example code. <br />
        1 var correctAnswer = "Vatican"; <br />
        2 if (x === correctAnswer) { <br />
        3 alert("Correct!"); <br />
        4 } <br />
        When a condition is met, you can have any number of statements execute.
        <br />
        1 var correctAnswer = "Vatican"; <br />
        2 if (x === correctAnswer) { <br />
        3 score++; <br />
        4 userIQ = "genius"; <br />
        5 alert("Correct!"); <br />
        6 } <br />

    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>-: Comparison operators :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Let's talk a little more about ===. It's a type of comparison operator,
        specifically an <br />
        equality operator. As you learned in the last chapter, you use it to
        compare two things to see if <br />
        they're equal. <br />
        You can use the equality operator to compare a variable with a string, a
        variable with a <br />
        number, a variable with a math expression, or a variable with a
        variable. And you can use it to <br />
        compare various combinations. All of the following are legal first lines
        in if statements: <br />
        if (fullName === "Mark" + " " + "Myers") { <br />
        if (fullName === firstName + " " + "Myers") { <br />
        if (fullName === firstName + " " + "Myers") { <br />
        if (fullName === "firstName + " " + lastName) { <br />
        if (totalCost === 81.50 + 135) { <br />
        if (totalCost === materialsCost + 135) { <br />
        if (totalCost === materialsCost + laborCost) { <br />
        if (x + y === a - b) { <br />
        When you're comparing strings, the equality operat or is case-sensitive.
        "Rose" does not <br />
        equal "rose." <br />
        Another comparison operator, !==, is the opposite of ===. It means is
        not equal to. <br />
        1 if (yourTicketNumber !== 487208) { <br />
        2 alert("Better luck next time."); <br />
        3 } <br />
        Like ===, the not-equal operator can be used to compare numbers,
        strings, variables, <br />
        expressions, and combinations. <br />
        Like ===, string comparisons using the not-equal operator are
        case-sensitive. It's true that <br />
        "Rose" !== "rose". <br />
        Here are 4 more comparison operators, usually used to compare numbers.
        <br />
        > is greater than <br />
        < is less than <br />
        >= is greater than or equal to <br />
        <= is less than or equal to <br />
        In the examples below, all the conditions are true. <br />
        if (1 > 0) { <br />
        if (0 < 1) { <br />
        if (1 >= 0) { <br />
        if (1 >= 1) { <br />
        if (0 <= 1) { <br />
        if (1 <= 1) { <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>-: If statements nested :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Check out this code. <br />
        1 if ((x === y || a === b) && c === d) { <br />
        2 g = h; <br />
        3 } <br />
        4 else { <br />
        5 e = f; <br />
        6 } <br />
        In the code above, if either of the first conditions is true, and, in
        addition, the third <br />
        condition is true, then g is assigned h. Otherwise, e is assigned f.
        <br />
        There's another way to code this, using nesting. <br />
        1 if (c === d) { <br />
        2 if (x === y) { <br />
        3 g = h; <br />
        4 } <br />
        5 else if (a === b) { <br />
        6 g = h; <br />
        7 } <br />
        8 else { <br />
        9 e = f; <br />
        10 } <br />
        11 } <br />
        12 else { <br />
        13 e = f; <br />
        14 } <br />
        Nest levels are communicated to JavaScript by the positions of the curly
        brackets. There <br />
        are three blocks nested inside the top-level if. If the condition tested
        by the top-level if—that c <br />
        has the same value as d—is false, none of the blocks nested inside
        executes. The opening curly <br />
        bracket on line 1 and the closing curly bracket on line 11 enclose all
        the nested code, telling <br />
        JavaScript that everything inside is second-level. <br />
        For readability, a lower level is indented 2 spaces beyond the level
        above it. <br />
        In the relatively simple set of tests and outcomes shown in this
        example, I would prefer to <br />
        use the more concise structure of multiple conditions. But when things
        get really complicated, <br />
        nested ifs are a good way to go. <br />
